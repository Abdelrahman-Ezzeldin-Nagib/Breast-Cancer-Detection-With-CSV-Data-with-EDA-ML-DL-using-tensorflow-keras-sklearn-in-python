# Breast-Cancer-Detection-With-CSV-Data-with-EDA-ML-DL-using-tensorflow-keras-sklearn-in-python
This project is includes a very comprehensive clean python code for explanatory data analysis on Wisconsin breast cancer dataset with helpful insights for feature selection and dimensionality reduction along with training machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine {SVM}, ensemble of random forest classifiers) and deep learning models {ANN or what may be known as Dense Neural Networks} with outstanding results.

The data is provided in the file data_2.csv
the python code is avilable in the "Breast Cancer Detection Project.jpynb" file as a jupyter notebook file extension.
